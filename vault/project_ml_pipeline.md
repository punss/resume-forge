# Project: scalable Machine Learning Pipeline

## Overview
Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for real-time fraud detection, processing millions of transactions daily.

## Key Metrics
- Improved fraud detection accuracy by **15%** compared to the legacy rule-based system.
- Reduced model training time from **3 days** to **12 hours** using distributed training.
- Achieved sub-50ms inference latency for real-time transactions.

## Technical Details
- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Technologies**: Apache Airflow, TensorFlow, AWS SageMaker, Docker
- Orchestrated complex data workflows using Airflow DAGs for data ingestion, cleaning, and feature engineering.
- Utilized TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for model validation and serving.
- Deployed the inference API on AWS Lambda for auto-scaling capabilities.

## Context
- Collaborated closely with data scientists to optimize feature selection and model hyperparameters.
- Implemented A/B testing framework to safely roll out new model versions.
